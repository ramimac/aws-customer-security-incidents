# Background

Security is an exercise in managing risk. Reviewing the common root causes of security incidents is an effective way to guide prioritized remediation efforts.

This repository seeks to index all publicly disclosed AWS customer security incidents with a known root cause. It will exclude incidents involving exposed data stores (e.g S3 bucket leaks, exposed managed or hosted databases).
Those incidents are already well understood, and examples can be found cataloged in places like [nagwww's s3-leaks repo](https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks), [upguard's reports](https://www.upguard.com/breaches), [hackmeggedon's annual rollup reports (2022)](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/02/21/leaky-buckets-in-2022/) and [Corey Quinn's LWIAWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com) S3 Bucket Negligence Award.

It also excludes incidents impacting individuals, such as the periodic reports of cryptomining due to compromised credentials.

### A Note on Blameless Postmortems

This repository is in no way intended as a criticism of the listed companies. In the spirit of blameless postmortems [<sup>1</sup>](#1), our goal is to learn from incidents without an atmosphere of blame.

The attacker compromises an instance (often via phishing a user/admin, not always direct compromise), then installs their malware to encrypt the data and spread to other reachable instances. This is really no different than ransomware in a data center since it doesn’t involve anything cloud-specific.<br />The attacker copies data out of an S3 bucket and then deletes the original data. This is the most commonly seen cloud native ransomware on AWS.|

### Catalog of AWS Exploits via SSRF

[Server-side request forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/) is a class of attack that is not cloud or AWS specific. However, the existence of cloud metadata services, such as [IMDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) in AWS, have historically allowed for a substantial straightforward impact when SSRF is achieved on a cloud hosted application. For that reason, we include this list of SSRF attacks against AWS environments.
