# Background

Cloud security must be threat-informed. This repository compiles public data on security incidents impacting AWS customers, to guide prioritized security investment.

This repository seeks to index all publicly disclosed AWS customer security incidents with a known root cause. 

It will exclude incidents involving exposed data stores (e.g S3 bucket leaks, exposed managed or hosted databases). Those incidents are already well understood, and examples can be found cataloged in places like [nagwww's s3-leaks repo](https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks), [upguard's reports](https://www.upguard.com/breaches), [hackmeggedon's annual rollup reports (2022)](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/02/21/leaky-buckets-in-2022/) and [Corey Quinn's LWIAWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com) S3 Bucket Negligence Award.


### A Note on Blameless Postmortems

This repository is in no way intended as a criticism of the listed companies. In the spirit of blameless postmortems [<sup>1</sup>](#1), our goal is to learn from incidents without an atmosphere of blame.
