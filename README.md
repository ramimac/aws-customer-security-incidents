# Background

Security is an exercise in managing risk. Reviewing the common root causes of security incidents is an effective way to guide prioritized remediation efforts.

This repository seeks to index all publicly disclosed AWS customer security incidents with a known root cause. It will exclude incidents involving exposed data stores (e.g S3 bucket leaks, exposed managed or hosted databases).
Those incidents are already well understood, and examples can be found cataloged in places like [nagwww's s3-leaks repo](https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks), [upguard's reports](https://www.upguard.com/breaches), [hackmeggedon's annual rollup reports (2022)](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/02/21/leaky-buckets-in-2022/) and [Corey Quinn's LWIAWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com) S3 Bucket Negligence Award.

It also excludes incidents impacting individuals, such as the periodic reports of cryptomining due to compromised credentials.

### A Note on Blameless Postmortems

This repository is in no way intended as a criticism of the listed companies. In the spirit of blameless postmortems [<sup>1</sup>](#1), our goal is to learn from incidents without an atmosphere of blame.

## "State of the Cloud" Report Incident Takeaways

| Report | Takeaways | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Palo Alto Unit 42: [Cloud Threat Report H2 2020](https://falksangdata.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unit-42-cloud-threat-report-2h-2020.pdf) | Unit 42 research shows that cryptojacking affects at least 23% of organizations globally that maintain cloud infrastructure |
| Accenture: [Cyber Threat Intelligence Report Volume 2 - 2021](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobdjwilson/awesome-annual-security-reports/main/Annual%20Security%20Reports/2022/Accenture-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Report-Vol2-2022.pdf) | Cloud environments were and continue to be attractive targets, perhaps due to lower monitoring levels than on-premise environments. ... cloud-related malware has evolved faster than more traditional malware in 2021 based on analysis of the rate of code changes between cryptominers (a primary malware malicious actors deploy in compromised cloud environments) compared to code changes in botnets and ransomware ... Accenture observed ransomware and extortion operators targeting cloud infrastructure and hosted backups in attempts to increase operational impact | 
| Fugue: [The State of Cloud Security 2021](https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/4846674/Resources%20Content/State_of_Cloud_Security_2021.pdf) | N/A |

| IDC for Ermetic: [State of Cloud Security 2021](https://www.vpngids.nl/wp-content/uploads/ermetic-idc-survey-report-state-of-cloud-security-2021.pdf) | Most organizations (63%) confirmed that their sensitive data has been exposed in the cloud |
| Snyk: [State of Cloud Native Application Security 2021](https://go.snyk.io/rs/677-THP-415/images/State%20of%20CNAS.pdf) | Over 56% experienced a misconfiguration or known unpatched vulnerability incident involving their cloud native applications |
| GCP: [November 2021 Cloud Threat Intelligence report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/gcat-threathorizons-full-nov2021.pdf) | Of 50 recently compromised GCP instances, 86% of the compromised Google Cloud instances were used to perform cryptocurrency mining |
| AWS: [2022 re:Inforce session on ransomware](https://www.firemon.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ransomware-in-aws) h/t [Rich Mogull](https://twitter.com/rmogull)  | ransomware is a common problem for AWS customers, stemming from two common exploit vectors:<br />A traditional ransomware attack against instances in AWS. The attacker compromises an instance (often via phishing a user/admin, not always direct compromise), then installs their malware to encrypt the data and spread to other reachable instances. This is really no different than ransomware in a data center since it doesn’t involve anything cloud-specific.<br />The attacker copies data out of an S3 bucket and then deletes the original data. This is the most commonly seen cloud native ransomware on AWS.| 
| AWS: [AWS CIRT announces the release of five publicly available workshops](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-cirt-announces-the-release-of-five-publicly-available-workshops/) | Over the past year, AWS CIRT has responded to hundreds of such security events, including the unauthorized use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials, ransomware and data deletion in an AWS account, and billing increases due to the creation of unauthorized resources to mine cryptocurrency. | 
| CheckPoint: [Cyber Security Report 2022](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobdjwilson/awesome-annual-security-reports/main/Annual%20Security%20Reports/2022/CheckPoint-Cybersecurity-Report-2022.pdf) | Since late 2021, we have witnessed a wave of attacks leveraging flaws in the services of industry-leading cloud service providers | 
| CrowdStrike: [2022 Global Threat Report](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2022GTR.pdf) | Cloud-related threats are particularly likely to become more prevalent and to evolve, given that targeted intrusion adversaries are expected to continue prioritizing targets that provide direct access to large consolidated stores of high-value data |
| CrowdStrike: [Protectors of the Cloud eBook](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/eBookProtectorsoftheCloudEng.pdf) | CrowdStrike continues to see adversary activity in three particular areas concerning the cloud:<br />Neglected cloud infrastructure that is slated for retirement yet still contains sensitive data<br />A lack of outbound restrictions and workload protection to exfiltrate your data<br />Adversaries leveraging common cloud services to obfuscate malicious activity |
| Datadog: [State of AWS Security 2022](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-aws-security/) | N/A |
| ENISA [Threat Landscape 2022](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-threats/threats-and-trends) | Cybercriminals target cloud services mostly in the following ways. <br /> * Exploiting cloud vulnerabilities: virtualisation infrastructure has been increasingly targeted (e.g. VMWare vSphere and ESXi platforms) by cybercriminals and especially by ransomware groups.<br />• Using cloud services for hosting their infrastructure: cybercriminals take advantage of the highly scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure and use legitimate cloud services to bypass security controls by blending into normal network traffic.<br />• Targeting cloud credentials: cybercriminals use social engineering attacks to harvest credentials for cloud services (e.g. Microsoft Office 365, Okta, etc.).<br />• Exploiting misconfigured image containers cybercriminals increasingly target poorly configured Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters.<br />• Targeting cloud instances for cryptomining (e.g. TeamTNT group): security researchers have identified a cloud-focused toolset from the TeamTNT group.<br />• Targeting cloud infrastructure (e.g. Azure AD), cloud application programming interfaces (APIs), and cloud-hosted backups by ransomware groups to infiltrate cloud environments and increase impact. |
| Expel: [Q1 2022 Threat Report](https://expel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Expel-QTR-051822.pdf) | Misconfigurations and exposed long-term credentials in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounted for 3% of incidents<br />These incidents break down into two categories:<br />1. Admins accidentally setting AWS S3 Buckets to Public<br />2. Threat actors gaining access to exposed long-lived credentials in AWS and GCP, which resulted in unauthorized access |
| Fidelis: [2022 AWS Cloud Security Report](https://connect.fidelissecurity.com/rs/884-ZRZ-648/images/2022-AWS-Cloud-Security-Report.pdf) | For the 31% of organizations that experienced a security incident in the cloud, misconfiguration was the leading cause (28%), followed by inappropriately shared data (17%) and account compromise (15%).

### Catalog of AWS Exploits via SSRF

[Server-side request forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/) is a class of attack that is not cloud or AWS specific. However, the existence of cloud metadata services, such as [IMDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) in AWS, have historically allowed for a substantial straightforward impact when SSRF is achieved on a cloud hosted application. For that reason, we include this list of SSRF attacks against AWS environments.
