| AWS: [2022 re:Inforce session on ransomware](https://www.firemon.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ransomware-in-aws) h/t [Rich Mogull](https://twitter.com/rmogull)  | ransomware is a common problem for AWS customers, stemming from two common exploit vectors:<br />A traditional ransomware attack against instances in AWS. The attacker compromises an instance (often via phishing a user/admin, not always direct compromise), then installs their malware to encrypt the data and spread to other reachable instances. This is really no different than ransomware in a data center since it doesn’t involve anything cloud-specific.<br />The attacker copies data out of an S3 bucket and then deletes the original data. This is the most commonly seen cloud native ransomware on AWS.|
